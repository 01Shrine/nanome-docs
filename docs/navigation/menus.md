The Load, Plugin, Display, Color, Modify, Select, and Macro Menus can be displayed by clicking their respective icons located at the bottom of the Entry Menu.

![](/assets/compressed/navigating-page/Entry-Atom.jpg)

Different Viewing Modes can be toggled to modify the substructure icon sizes in each menu.

### Frame Data

![](/assets/compressed/navigating-page/Entry-FrameData.jpg)

Frame data allows users to navigate and modify different frames of the same structure (Academic and Enterprise only).
