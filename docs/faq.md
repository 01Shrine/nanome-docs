## What is Nanome?
Nanome Inc is our company which creates virtual reality tools for scientists, researchers and educators. Nanome is the premiere Virtual Reality software solution for molecular modeling and protein visualization. Understanding molecular structures in Nanome is intuitive, hands on, and efficient. The word Nanome is like Genome where we are exploring the entire field of Nano-sciences and Nanotechnology - everything at the Nanoscale!

## Why was Nanome founded?
Nanome’s mission is to democratize science. By creating intuitive and immersive tools, we hope to empower today’s scientists and inspire tomorrow’s. Nanome values powerful interfaces, open access, and collaboration. We are committed to elevating access to science and technology.

## What problem are you solving?
Innovators in molecular sciences face three major difficulties:

The physical world at the nanoscale is invisible and conceptually abstract.

Current software used to visualize the nanoscale is unintuitive and frustrating to use.

It is impossible for teams to collaborate effectively in the same digital workspace with 2D software. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrdpHPAbi48

## Who typically uses Nanome?
Nanome was developed with pharmaceutical scientists and computational chemists in mind. Nanome partners with major pharmaceutical companies and various research institutions to help increase productivity in Nanoscaled design. Nanome is also a “sandbox” tool and is used by thousands of people passionate or curious about science, ranging from gamers and hobbyists to educators and students.

## Where can I download Nanome?
Nanome can be downloaded for free from all major Virtual Reality stores including Oculus, VivePort, and Steam. Premium versions with upgraded features are available for purchase from our website at https://nanome.ai/pricing/

## How does Nanome help researchers?
Understanding complex 3D geometries and relationships on legacy interfaces can be frustrating, difficult and slow. Using 3D visualization and interaction, researchers understand concepts and innovate more rapidly.

## Can I get Nanome/CalcFlow for my school?
Nanome tools are made for communicating and sharing traditionally complicated concepts. Collaborative interaction paired with 2D viewing mode makes Nanome perfect for giving lectures, creating presentations, and making homework more engaging. See some example of educators using Nanome at www.twitch.tv/nanome_inc

## What is Nanotechnology?
Nanotechnology refers to any design or engineering occurring at the molecular or atomic level. Simple drugs are the earliest form of nanotechnology, but today almost every industry is becoming a nano-industry. Faster computers, powerful batteries, and advanced robotics all rely on nanoscale design. Learn more on our blog at blog.matryx.ai

## Is VR really better than my monitor?
An immersive, virtual environment adds an additional dimension to learning and research, like having superpowers. VR enables users to immerse themselves inside complex concepts and not just visualize, but experience them.

## I want to inquire about a special interest or investment.
Please contact Nanome at hello@nanome.ai for more information.

## Software Features
What makes Nanome different from existing molecular design software?
Nanome makes nanoscience immediately obvious and accessible. Other scientific software requires users to write code and have extensive scientific background to perform even simple tasks. Nanome is specially designed for usability, collaboration, and immersion.

Usability: Nanome’s intuitive user interface is easy for anyone to use. It does not rely on mouse and keyboard, but instead uses human-understandable interfaces such as picking up a virtual molecules by reaching out and grabbing them with your hands.

Collaboration: The internet has increased collaboration amongst scientists, but the way they communicate has barely changed. Real-time verbal and physical collaboration in virtual space increases efficiency, saving time and accelerating research.

Immersion: Virtual reality, the cornerstone of the Nanome software, has potential far beyond gaming. Nanome is the first company to utilize VR to make tools specifically for scientists and enthusiasts. Three-dimensional visualization and interaction bring clarity to complex scientific concepts.

## What are the main features of the Nanome Software?
Nanome Users can….

Import molecular structures from online databases such as RCSB Protein Databank, Pubchem and Drugbank.

Manipulate molecules and nano-structures by literally reaching out and grabbing, rotating, or enlarging the area of interest with their hands.

Apply different representations to their selection of Atoms, Residues, Chains, or Proteins such as Stick, Wire, Ball & Stick, or Van der Waals.

Measure distance and angles between atoms.

Mutate amino acids and cycle through rotamer conformations.

Design small molecules and nano-structures by building with any element from the periodic table.

Minimize manipulated molecules to fix bond lengths, angles, prevent clashes and provide a local energy minimum conformation.

Duplicate or Split any selected area of their structure to modify or export independently.

Join a virtual reality session as a guest with or without virtual reality hardware using 2D mode.

Present and collaborate in the same virtual environment with colleagues and friends to learn, explore, and create.

Use our in-app camera to capture and export images of their work.

Join public and/or private virtual rooms to collaborate.

Save and export modified or created molecules and nano-structures

## What file types are compatible with Nanome?
Nanome supports .pdb, .sdf, and features limited compatibility with other atomic coordinate files, like .cif. While .pdb or .sdf format are the most stable formats, we are always improving our parser’s ability to handle anomalies.

Structures may be imported directly from RCSB Protein Data Bank, PubChem, DrugBank, and other online databases from the VR Molecular Loading Menu.

We recommend setting Nanome as your default software for opening .pdb files. Double clicking on any local .pdb will automatically open the file with the Nanome software.

## How many users can I have inside of Nanome
Nanome currently supports up to 20 VR collaborators in a room. Our 2D user allows for up to 100 users in a single room.

## What kinds of computations are possible with Nanome? 
Nanome has a Python based API to integrate with user's computational tools to augment and benefit existing scientific workflows. With a plugin script capable of interfacing with any of the existing applications, the computation possiblities are endless. While this feature is limited to users with a Plugin Server (Enterprise only), we do natively support classical force field simulations for local minimization.  Nanome users can also utilize other simulation software through just exporting as a .sdf and .pdb file and into 3rd part simulation software, then importing the final .pdb or .sdf results back into Nanome after computations have been run.


We’re streamlining this process with an API pipeline, so users can send their work directly to their GPU or a cloud service running alternative molecular simulation software.

## What is 2D mode?
2D mode is a free feature for all Nanome account holders. In 2D mode, users may join a Nanome room from a 2D interface. A 2D user moves a camera with their mouse and keyboard, enabling them to spectate and record sessions, but cannot interact with structures. 2D mode can be accessed on Steam or if Nanome is downloaded on our website. While 2D mode can also be accessed on Oculus, you’ll need to have a headset connected.

## What is Matryx?
Nanome created Matryx, a blockchain platform and ERC20 token [MTX] to foster global collaboration in the sciences. On the Matryx blockchain platform, Nanome users may upload and timestamp their creations and designs, enabling immutable attribution for their work. Matryx users may post bounties with their MTX tokens, hosting tournaments for the design, revision, or solutions to a scientific problems or other tasks. To learn more about the Matryx platform, check out our blog and read our whitepaper.

## How do I use Matryx with Nanome?
Currently, the Matryx testnet is accessible via CalcFlow and a web interface at alpha.matryx.ai while seamless Nanome integration is coming soon.
