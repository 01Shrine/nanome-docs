# FAQ

## What VR headsets does Nanome support?
Nanome is available on the Oculus Rift/S, HTC Vive, Valve Index, Windows Mixed Reality, and the Oculus Quest.

## Where can I download Nanome?
Nanome can be downloaded for free from all major Virtual Reality stores including Oculus, VivePort, and Steam, or directly from https://home.nanome.ai/setup. Premium versions with upgraded features are available for purchase from our website at https://nanome.ai/pricing/

## If I don’t have a VR device, can I still use Nanome?
Yes, Nanome has a 2D desktop mode for users without VR devices. In 2D mode, users may join a Nanome room from a 2D interface. A 2D user moves a camera with their mouse and keyboard, enabling them to spectate and record sessions, but cannot interact with structures. 2D mode can be accessed on Steam or if Nanome is downloaded on our website. While 2D mode can also be accessed on Oculus, you’ll need to have a headset connected.

## What are the System Requirements to run Nanome in VR?
Please visit https://home.nanome.ai/setup for Minimum and Recommended computer specs

## Can I use Nanome on Mac/Linux?
Nanome does not currently support Mac or Linux. Windows is the primary operating system for using VR headsets and represents the best way to use Nanome. Additionally, Nanome is compatible with the Oculus Quest mobile headset. 

## Do I need Internet connection to use Nanome?
A stable Internet connection is highly recommended when using Nanome, especially when collaborating with other users. Access to the web is also necessary to download structures from databases like RCSB and DrugBank Databases. For solo users with structures stored on their local machines, internet access is not required.

## How many users can join a Nanome session at the same time?
Nanome currently supports up to 20 collaborators in a room. Soon, more spectators will be able to join in 2D.

## What file formats doe Nanome support? How can I import them?
Nanome supports .pdb, .sdf, and features limited compatibility with other atomic coordinate files, like .cif. While .pdb or .sdf format are the most stable formats, we are always improving our parser’s ability to handle anomalies.

An exhaustive list of supported file formats includes: pdb, .cif, .mmcif, .sdf, .mol, .xyz, .mol2, .ccp4, .dsn6, .dcd, .gro, .pqr, .trr, .xtc, .psf, .pse, .nanome, .png, .jpg, .jpeg, .pdf

Structures may be imported directly from RCSB Protein Data Bank, PubChem, DrugBank, and other online databases from the VR Molecular Loading Menu.

We recommend setting Nanome as your default software for opening .pdb files. Double-clicking on any local .pdb will automatically open the file with the Nanome software.
