# FAQ

## What is Nanome?
Nanome is a collaborative virtual-reality molecular modelling tool made for professional researchers working on structures and proteins at the nano scale. Analyze the 3D arrangement of molecules while inside of a protein binding pocket, surround your self in crystal data, or communicate your ligand design to your colleagues in the same virtual room. No matter what you do, Nanome empowers your research and enhances your understanding like no other tools have before. Whether you are a structural biologist, crystallographer, computational chemist, medicinal chemist, or a protein engineer, you will find your daily workflow much more intrigueing and effective in Nanome because of the power of VR. 

## What VR headsets does Nanome support?
Nanome is available on the Oculus Rift/S, HTC Vive, Vive Cosmos, Vive Pro, Valve Index, Windows Mixed Reality, and the Oculus Quest.

## Where can I download Nanome?
Nanome can be downloaded for free from all major Virtual Reality stores including [Oculus](https://nanome.ai/pricing/), [Steam](https://nanome.ai/pricing/), and [VivePort](https://www.viveport.com/apps/0a467f78-2ed2-43eb-ada8-9d677d5acf54/Nanome/), or directly from [https://home.nanome.ai/setup](https://home.nanome.ai/setup). Premium versions with upgraded features are available for purchase from our website at [https://nanome.ai/pricing/](https://nanome.ai/pricing/).

## If I don’t have a VR device, can I still use Nanome?
Yes, Nanome has a 2D desktop mode for users without VR devices. In 2D mode, users may join a Nanome room from a 2D interface. A 2D user moves a camera with their mouse and keyboard, enabling them to spectate and record sessions, but cannot interact with structures. 2D mode can be accessed on [Steam](https://nanome.ai/pricing/) or if Nanome is downloaded on our [website](https://home.nanome.ai/setup). While 2D mode can also be accessed on Oculus, you’ll need to have a headset connected.

## What are the System Requirements to run Nanome in VR?
#### The recommended specs for desktop computer:
- Intel i7 or Xeon
- GTX 1070 GPU, 1080, 1080Ti, Titan Xp
- 8GB RAM
- 256 GB SSD
- Windows 10 Operating System
#### The recommended specs for laptop:
- Intel i7
- GTX 1060 GPU
- 8GB RAM
- 256 GB SSD
- Windows 10 Operating System

## Can I use Nanome on Mac/Linux?
Nanome does not currently support Mac or Linux. Windows is the primary operating system for using VR headsets and represents the best way to use Nanome. Additionally, Nanome is compatible with the Oculus Quest mobile headset. 

## Do I need Internet connection to use Nanome?
A stable Internet connection is highly recommended when using Nanome, especially when collaborating with other users. Access to the web is also necessary to download structures from databases like RCSB and DrugBank Databases. For solo users with structures stored on their local machines, internet access is not required.

## How many users can join a Nanome session at the same time?
Nanome currently supports up to 20 collaborators in a room. Soon, more spectators will be able to join in 3D.

## What file formats doe Nanome support? How can I import them?
Nanome supports .pdb, .sdf, and features limited compatibility with other atomic coordinate files, like .cif. While .pdb or .sdf format are the most stable formats, we are always improving our parser’s ability to handle anomalies.

An exhaustive list of supported file formats includes: pdb, .cif, .mmcif, .sdf, .mol, .xyz, .mol2, .ccp4, .dsn6, .dcd, .gro, .pqr, .trr, .xtc, .psf, .pse, .nanome, .png, .jpg, .jpeg, .pdf

Structures may be imported directly from RCSB Protein Data Bank, PubChem, DrugBank, and other online databases from the VR Molecular Loading Menu.

We recommend setting Nanome as your default software for opening .pdb files. Double-clicking on any local .pdb will automatically open the file with the Nanome software.

## Can I use this for my school?
