# Nanome

Nanome is a collaborative virtual reality tool for nanoscale design.

## Overview


Nanome is changing how we understand, design, and interact with science. We develop intuitive and collaborative virtual reality tools for experimentation, collaboration, and learning at the molecular level. Nanomeâ€™s immersive virtual workspaces allow users to visualize, modify, and simulate chemical compounds, proteins, and nucleic acids to help improve the Drug Discovery process.

Users can load molecular structures from various common libraries such as [PDB.org](https://www.wwpdb.org/), [Drugbank](https://www.drugbank.ca/), and [Pubchem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)
