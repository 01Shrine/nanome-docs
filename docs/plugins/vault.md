### Folders

At the root level, there are two folders: **shared** and **account**.

The **shared** folder is accessible to all users connected to the plugin, whereas the **account** folder is only accessible to your Nanome account.

To log in on the web interface, either click the "log in" next to "Welcome!", or double-click the **account** folder. Enter your Nanome account credentials in the popup that appears and click "log in".
