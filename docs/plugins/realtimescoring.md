# Real-time Scoring
The Real-time Scoring plugin lets you score ligands against a receptor to determine binding affinity for their current structure, position and rotation.

To use this plugin, simply select a receptor (left pane), the ligands you would like to score (right pane), and press "Start scoring". Each ligand's score will appear on the scoring window. Atom scores will be shown via their radii and atom's will be labeled with their symbol.
