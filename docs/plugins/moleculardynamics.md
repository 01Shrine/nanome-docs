The Molecular Dynamics plugin runs simple molecular dynamics simulations on single complexes within the workspace.

This plugin requires a working version of openmm. To install:
- Install Anaconda3
- conda install -c omnia openmm
- pip install nanome-molecular-dynamics

To use the plugin, simply select the target complex you'd like to run a simulation on and press Start. If you add an additional complex to the workspace, pressing the Refresh button will update your Target complex list, allowing you to run a simulation on the new desired target.
