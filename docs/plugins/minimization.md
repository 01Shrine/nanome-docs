# Minimization
The minimization plugin arranges the selected molecule to find a geometry where inter-atomic forces are as close to zero as possible.

To use the minimization plugin, Activate it from the plugin menu, select one or more complexes from the entry menu, then press Run.
The selected structures will have their bounding boxes turned on and their energies minimized.

The minimization process can be stopped at any time by pressing the Stop button.
